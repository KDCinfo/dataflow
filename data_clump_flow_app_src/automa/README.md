# Automa

## Web Automation Testing

> [Automa Home](https://automa.site)

Testing is done via the 'Automa' Chrome plugin (MV3-compatible).

- When opening the plugin's full panel you can import the attached test scripts.

### Automa Workflow Files:

The following will simply add 4 cells into Column 1.

- dataflow-col1.automa.json

This workflow will add those same 4 cells, but will also add a clump to the right of the 2nd cell.

- dataflow-col2.automa.json

### Custom Packages Used in Workflows:

- df column1.automa-pkg.json
- df column2.automa-pkg.json
