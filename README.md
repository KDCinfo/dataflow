# Data Flow Projects

There are two projects in this repository:

- The '[Data Clump Flow App](https://github.com/KDCinfo/dataflow/tree/main/data_clump_flow_app)' is a fully working app with a live demo.
- The 'Function Flow' app was barely started and never followed up on.

## 1. Data Mapping Flow Analysis Tool

- GitHub Code: [./data_clump_flow_app](https://github.com/KDCinfo/dataflow/tree/main/data_clump_flow_app)
- Live Demo: [kdcinfo.com/app/dataflow/](https://kdcinfo.com/app/dataflow/)

The "Data Mapping Flow Analysis Tool" was conceptualized while analyzing a variety of `Jenkinsfile`s from multiple sources, and the environments, stages, and flows within each.

- The primary thought was to try to keep the flow simple (a sticking point in previous flow-recording app attempts):
  - Cell content: Title.
  - Cell content: Data clump that can be expanded.
- Data nodes are either linked to, or simply follow other cells.
- Initialized: Nov 2024

## 2. Function Flow

- GitHub Code: [./function_flow](https://github.com/KDCinfo/dataflow/tree/main/function_flow)

> **This app is unfinished** (barely started, actually)

The "Function Flow" code was conceptualized when I was analyzing various function flows within an app.

- This flow attempted to capture multiple functional flows throughout an app.
- It focused on attempting to link functions based on relevant flow points.
- Initialized: Mar 2024
